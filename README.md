This chrome extension adds polyratings to the class selections on PASS to help students save time when registering for classes.

Features:
* Rating and number of evaluations appear below the instructor's name
* Background behind the instructor's name changes color (green = good, yellow = pretty good, orange = okay, red = bad)
* Click on any teacher's name to see their full Polyratings page (if it exists)
* Options to hide cancelled or conflicting classes
