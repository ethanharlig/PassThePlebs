This chrome extension adds polyratings to the class selections on PASS to help students save time when registering for classes.

Features:
* Rating appears below the teacher's name
* Background behind the teacher's name changes color (green = good, yellow = okay, orange = not so good, red = bad)
* Click on any teacher's name to see their full Polyratings page
